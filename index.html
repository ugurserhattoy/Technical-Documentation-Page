                    React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and 
                    <strong>you can use as little or as much React as you need</strong>. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.

                    If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, or Glitch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos.

                You can add React to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.

                    When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!

                <p>
                    As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem.

It introduces the most important React concepts in a detailed, beginner-friendly way. Once you’re done, give the documentation another try!

                    The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We recommend going through this JavaScript overview to check your knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React.

                    If you prefer to <strong>learn by doing</strong>, check out our practical tutorial. In this tutorial, we build a tic-tac-toe game in React. You might be tempted to skip it because you’re not building games — but give it a chance. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React apps, and mastering it will give you a much deeper understanding.

                    Many React users credit reading Thinking in React as the moment React finally “clicked” for them. It’s probably the oldest React walkthrough but it’s still just as relevant.

                    It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.

                    The React blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted there first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also follow the @reactjs account on Twitter, but you won’t miss anything essential if you only read the blog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release in the CHANGELOG.md file in the React repository, as well as on the Releases page.
